        <h2>Desciption</h2>
        <p>The chawal ki kheer made at the Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Kerala is world-famous. Made by simmering rice and milk in heavy, large bronze vessels for a long time, this rice kheer has a rich taste and attractive pink colour that comes out of the natural thickening of milk.</p>

            <li>4 cups full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup long grained rice (basmati)</li>
