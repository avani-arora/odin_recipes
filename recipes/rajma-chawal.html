    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and soak the rajma (kidney beans) in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.</li>
        <li>Next day, discard the water and rinse the beans again in fresh water for a couple of times.</li>
        <li>Drain all the water.</li>
        <li>In a 3 litre pressure cooker, take both the soaked rajma and water.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook on a medium to high flame for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the rajma is cooking, you can chop the onions, tomatoes etc.</li>
        <li>Crush the ginger, garlic and green chillies in a mortar-pestle to a fine or semi-fine texture. Set aside
            When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid.</li>
        <li>Check if the rajma beans are cooked or not by taking a bite or pressing a few beans.</li>
        <li>If the beans are cooked well set aside or drain the beans.</li>
        <li>If the rajma are not cooked completely, then pressure cook again adding some water if required for some minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of water. If you prefer you can also add the cooked rajma stock instead of fresh water.</li>
        <li>Add salt as required and stir the whole curry mixture.</li>
        <li>On a low heat to medium-low heat simmer without a lid for 10 to 12 minutes or more time until the curry thickens slightly. It should not be watery.</li>
        <li>Mash a few rajma beans with the spoon. This helps to thicken the curry.</li>
        <li>When the rajma masala has thickened and comes to the right consistency which is neither too thick nor thin, then add the crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) and cream. You can skip the cream if you prefer.
            Stir and simmer for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve rajma masala with steamed basmati rice, jeera rice or naan or roti or paratha. You can garnish with some coriander leaves when serving.</li>
